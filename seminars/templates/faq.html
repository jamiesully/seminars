        in the text "Filter by topic", click "topic" to open the topics menu,
        press "Clear all" (if necessary) to deselect all topics,
        click on "combinatorics",
        and adjust the "Filter by topic" slider to the right.
        You can also select more than one topic.

         <i>Your</i> time zone, displayed at the upper right.
         <ul>
           <li>If you're logged in, this is the time zone associated with your account, which you can set on the Account page.</li>

         </ul><br>
         Exception (for organizers and speakers): When editing a seminar or talk, times are displayed in the time zone <i>of the seminar or talk</i>; this time zone can be set at the seminar's "Edit properties" page or the talk's "Edit talk" page, respectively.

        What are the benefits of <a href="{{ url_for('user.register') }}">registering</a>?
      </h4>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Registered users can save seminars and talks to their favorites.
            Then on the <a href="{{ url_for("index") }}">front page</a> they can click "Show only saved events" to display only those.
            Moreover, on the Account page, they can export these to their own calendars.
          </li>
          <li>
            Registered users can view all livestream links for connecting online to a talk.  (Many livestream links are viewable to all, but some seminar organizers may restrict access to registered users.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Registered users, once endorsed, can create their own seminars and conferences for others to see.

      <h4>
        If I export seminars to my Google calendar, do I have to export them again every week to see the latest talks?
      </h4>
      <p> No, once you export a seminar to your calendar, talks added to that seminar later will be pushed to your calendar automatically!</p>

      <h4>
        What should I do if I cannot connect to an online talk?  What if I need a link or password that is not listed?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Check the seminar's external webpage, usually reachable by clicking
        on the seminar name at the seminar's page at mathseminars.org.  Many seminars post
        passwords just before each talk starts or email them to users subscribed to their
        mailing list.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are still having trouble, contact one of the seminar's scientific organizers; you may need to go to the external webpage to find their contact details.

        How do I create a new seminar?
      </h4>
      <p><ol><li><a href="{{ url_for('user.register') }}">Register</a> for an account.</li>
          <li>Get your account endorsed by some other endorsed user.  (We require this for your seminars to be visible to others, as a security measure, to prevent spam on our site.)</li>
          <li>Click on the <a href="{{ url_for('create.index')}}">Create</a> tab and follow the instructions there.  (Note: After creating your first seminar, the "Create" tab will be renamed as "Manage".)</li>

      <h4>
        How do I create a new conference?

        The procedure is the same as for creating a new seminar.

      <h4>
        How can I endorse other users?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Once you are endorsed yourself, 
        click on the <a href="{{ url_for('user.info')}}">Account</a> tab, 
        scroll down to "Endorse someone to add content", 
        enter the email address of the person you would like to endorse, 
        and click "Endorse".
        Make an effort to verify beforehand that the email address is associated with 
        someone who would be adding appropriate content (generally mathematicians or mathematics department staff).

      <h4>
        Is it OK to add a seminar if I'm not one of the organizers?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The seminar organizers will likely be grateful for the assistance in spreading the word about their seminar.
        We suggest notifying them that you plan to add their seminar to this site.
        When entering the seminar details, uncheck the "Organizer" checkbox to the right of your name;
        if you then check "Display", the seminar page will list you as a curator instead of an organizer,
        and the organizers (or others) will be able to contact you if there are any errors.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>
        If someone else added my seminar to the site, how can I gain the ability to update it?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Hopefully that person contacted you or left contact information on the seminar page.
        If so, ask that person to endorse you and to add you to the list of organizers of the seminar; then you can edit it.
        If you don't want the seminar listed on this site, please ask <a href="mailto:edgarc@mit.edu">Edgar Costa</a> or <a href="mailto:roed@mit.edu">David Roe</a> to remove it.
      </p>

    <li>
      <h4>
        What should I do if I'm organizing a seminar that doesn't meet once a week?
      </h4>
      <p> If it meets every other week on the same day, set the Frequency to 14 in the "Edit properties" page for the seminar.
        If it meets multiple times per week, we don't currently support this (though we plan to in the future).  For now, we suggest changing the "talks per day" field in the Edit Properties page of the seminar to the number of times it meets per week, then editing the date on the schedule page.</p>

    <li>
      <h4>
        I added a topic to my seminar; why aren't the talks in my seminar listed when I filter by that topic?
      </h4>
      Talks inherit the seminar's attributes <i>at the time the talks are created</i> but are not affected by subsequent
      edits to the seminar.  If you want your seminar's new topic to apply to talks previously added to the seminar, 
      you need to add the topic manually to each such talk.  The same applies to other attributes, 
      such as language, room, livestream, and access.
